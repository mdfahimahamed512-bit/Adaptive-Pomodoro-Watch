Adaptive Pomodoro Watch ⏱️
Adaptive Pomodoro Watch is a TypeScript-powered productivity tool that tracks study/work sessions, measures user focus, and dynamically adjusts work–break cycles for maximum efficiency.
It goes beyond a standard timer by analyzing session feedback and suggesting optimal focus periods.
🚀 Key Features
Start, Pause, End work sessions with real-time timer
Record focus score (1–5) for each session
Adaptive optimal work duration calculation based on user feedback
Break tracking and session statistics
Clean, minimal, distraction-free UI
Fully client-side using TypeScript
💡 How It Works
Start Work: Timer begins counting down from the default or suggested optimal time.
Pause: Pauses session and increments break count.
End Session: Prompts user for focus score; system updates average focus and recalculates optimal work time.
Reset: Clears all session data and resets timer.
The tool measures both time and cognitive focus, giving a smarter alternative to traditional Pomodoro timers.
